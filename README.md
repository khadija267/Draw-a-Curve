# Draw-a-Curve
A neural network implementation with Feed Forward and Back-Propagation to be trained to draw a curve.
The Neural Network contains 2 hidden layer of 6 and 7 neurons respectivly, one input(a value  along the curve from 0 to one ), and 2 outputs representing the curve coordiates
## Feed Forward
We will use the logistic activation function
## Back-Propagation
Calculate the jacobian of cost function c (average function ) with respect to weights and biases in each layer.
