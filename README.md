# Draw-a-Curve
A Neural Network Implementation with Feed Forward and Back-Propagation to be trained to draw a Curve.
The Neural Network contains 2 hidden layer, one input(a value  along the curve from 0 to one ), and 2 outputs representing the curve coordiates
## Feed Forward
We will use the logistic activation function
## Back-Propagation
Calculate the jacobian of cost function c (average function ) with respect to weights and biases in each layer.
